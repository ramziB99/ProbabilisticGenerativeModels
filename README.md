# ProbabilisticGenerativeModels
## About
Recently, generative models have (again) become a hot topic in machine learning thanks to recent advances in deep learning. One of the benefit of these models is their ability to generate new data, see for example:
* face generation: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ 
* word generation: https://thisworddoesnotexist.com/

Moreover, they can be used for semi-supervised learning, feature extraction via latent variables, â€¦
In this course, we will first review the theoretical background required to understand modern generative models:
* Probabilities 
* Latent variables models 
* Expectation Maximization algorithm 
* Change of variable theorem  
* Neural parameterization of probability distributions

Based on this, we will study modern generative models based on neural networks:
* Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs),
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
* Flow models,
* Energy networks.
